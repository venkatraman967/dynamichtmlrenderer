how to run: use 'npm start' command

input: currently we have 2 sample input folders in "src/data" namely "mark.json" and "mark2.json"

You can just change the values in json to play with it and it will concurrently render in the html output

also on line 2 in "src/components/Main.js", you can switch the line from "import myJson from "../data/mark2.json";" to "import myJson from "../data/mark2.json";" to switch these inputs
